# Advent of Code 2023 Solution Repo
First of all, obviously don't look if you don't want to see my solutions. I choose JS for most simple quick math scripts even though I despise js in general. It is simple to throw together a quick script to test something with so it is my preferred method. Therefore most answers are in js. Occasionally throughout I may make some in a different language but who knows?  
I will only post my solutions 24 hrs after the day has passed.
